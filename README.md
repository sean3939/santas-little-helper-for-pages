# Santa's Little Helper (The Santa Scanner)

This is the version used to hose on Github pages. Minor tweaks needed to get it up and running.

## 🎄 How It Works

This is a **Serverless Client-Side Application** built with React, Vite, and the Google GenAI SDK. It relies entirely on the browser to orchestrate AI agents.

### The Architecture
1.  **The Elves (Data Gathering)**:
    -   **News**: Uses `gemini-2.5-pro` with **Google Search Grounding** to perform a live background check on any public figure.
    -   **GitHub**: Fetches raw user activity via the GitHub REST API to judge code quality and commit habits.
    -   **Reddit**: Attempts direct JSON fetching, falling back to Gemini Research if blocked by CORS.
    -   **Wikipedia**: Scrapes biographical data from the MediaWiki API.

2.  **The Brain (Judgment)**:
    -   **Model**: `gemini-2.5-pro`
    -   **Role**: Analyzes the raw text/JSON from the gathering phase. It operates on a strict System Instruction to output a structured JSON verdict including a "Naughty" or "Nice" rating (0-100), a witty persona title, and a rationale in Santa's voice.

3.  **The Toy Shop (Visualization)**:
    -   **Model**: `gemini-2.5-flash-image` (Internal Codename: **Nano Banana**)
    -   **Role**: Takes the `visual_prompt` generated by The Brain and creates a high-quality, 1:1 aspect ratio image of the specific gift or punishment (e.g., "A lump of coal with a 404 error carved into it").

4.  **The Concierge (Shopping)**:
    -   If a user scores >40, The Brain also generates specific real-world gift recommendations, which the UI links directly to Google Shopping.

## 🛠️ Setup & Usage

### Prerequisites
-   An API Key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudiocdn.com/app/apikey).




## 🎮 How to Use the Helper

-   **Newsworthy**: Type the name of any public figure (e.g., "Sam Altman", "Taylor Swift") or get real specific if you want to try to locate someone less well-known. The AI will search 2025 records to judge their recent behavior.
-   **Wiki Legacy**: Paste a full Wikipedia URL. Great for judging historical figures or fictional characters.
-   **Code-Based (GitHub)**: Enter a GitHub username. Santa judges you based on your commit messages, push times (3 AM commits = Naughty), and lack of documentation.
-   **Karma (Reddit)**: Enter a Reddit username. Santa analyzes your comments and posts to see if you are a troll or a helper. (Github pages version uses a Google grounding search to get an overview of the account given Reddit CORS restrictions)
