# Santa's Little Helper (The Santa Scanner)

**Congratulations! You've successfully stolen the sleigh.** 🛷💨

You are now the proud owner of the source code for the North Pole's most advanced judgment algorithm. This application uses Google's latest **Gemini 2.5** models to analyze social media footprints, judge souls, and visualize their rewards (or punishments) in real-time.

## 🎄 How It Works

This is a **Serverless Client-Side Application** built with React, Vite, and the Google GenAI SDK. It relies entirely on the browser to orchestrate AI agents.

### The Architecture
1.  **The Elves (Data Gathering)**:
    -   **News**: Uses `gemini-2.5-pro` with **Google Search Grounding** to perform a live background check on any public figure.
    -   **GitHub**: Fetches raw user activity via the GitHub REST API to judge code quality and commit habits.
    -   **Reddit**: Attempts direct JSON fetching, falling back to Gemini Research if blocked by CORS.
    -   **Wikipedia**: Scrapes biographical data from the MediaWiki API.

2.  **The Brain (Judgment)**:
    -   **Model**: `gemini-2.5-pro`
    -   **Role**: Analyzes the raw text/JSON from the gathering phase. It operates on a strict System Instruction to output a structured JSON verdict including a "Naughty" or "Nice" rating (0-100), a witty persona title, and a rationale in Santa's voice.

3.  **The Toy Shop (Visualization)**:
    -   **Model**: `gemini-2.5-flash-image` (Internal Codename: **Nano Banana**)
    -   **Role**: Takes the `visual_prompt` generated by The Brain and creates a high-quality, 1:1 aspect ratio image of the specific gift or punishment (e.g., "A lump of coal with a 404 error carved into it").

4.  **The Concierge (Shopping)**:
    -   If a user scores >40, The Brain also generates specific real-world gift recommendations, which the UI links directly to Google Shopping.

## 🛠️ Setup & Usage

### Prerequisites
-   Node.js (v18+)
-   A Google Cloud Project with the **Gemini API** enabled.
-   An API Key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudiocdn.com/app/apikey).

### Installation
1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Configure Environment**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
    ```env
    API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
    ```
3.  **Launch the Sleigh**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## 🎮 How to Use the Scanner

-   **In The News**: Type the name of any public figure (e.g., "Sam Altman", "Taylor Swift"). The AI will search 2025 records to judge their recent behavior.
-   **Wiki Legacy**: Paste a full Wikipedia URL. Great for judging historical figures or fictional characters.
-   **Code-Based (GitHub)**: Enter a GitHub username. Santa judges you based on your commit messages, push times (3 AM commits = Naughty), and lack of documentation.
-   **Karma (Reddit)**: Enter a Reddit username. Santa analyzes your comments and posts to see if you are a troll or a helper.

## 🎨 Customization

-   **Change Santa's Personality**: Edit `SANTA_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION` in `src/services/geminiService.ts`. You can make him meaner, nicer, or speak in Shakespearean English.
-   **Modify Visuals**: The app uses Tailwind CSS. Check `tailwind.config.js` (injected in `index.html`) for the custom "Santa" color palette.
